# AngularJS
My experiences with angular js
Some time back, we create an angular app for our customer on MEAN stack. They liked it very much. The app is an HR portal where they needed somepages so that 3rd party or contract employees' data can be maintained.
The app included a table where the admin of a particular 3rd party agency would see the employees listed.
However, they were fed up with the UX because of the clicks invloved and wanted to do row-wise inline editing of the data.
This sample app is somewhat optimized so that less db transaction are involved and allows user to do inline editing of rows.
# Pre-requisite:-
1. AngularJS 2. NodeJS 3. MongoDB

Install all node and mongo required library and create a directory where your application will reside.
Install npm with required libraries.
Create a folder static-file. Place index.html in it.
Create a folder as controllers in static-file folder and place controller in it.
Place server.js parallel to static-file folder and run npm start in the parent folder.
